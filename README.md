# Talent Guardian - Preventing Employee Attrition with ETL, DW and OLAP

Predict probability of an employee leaving a company and provide insights on how to prevent it.

## **Introduction**

This project was developed as an assignment in an Advanced Data Technologies course, included in my masters degree. Final goal was to perform all the phases of Extract Transform Load (ETL), while assembling a Data Warehouse (DW) infrastructure. The final product should also include a target audience and a finished algorithm that served it. In the end, some visualizations that showed the effectiveness of the product were developed through Online analytical processing (OLAP). 

The starting point was the [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance](IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance) downloaded from the Kaggle platform. Although a small and synthetic dataset, it was enough to perform all the steps needed for the product. This was valid since the DW was successfully populated and could be accesses from various queries.

The final presentation and full description of the work developed is presented in the **FinalReport.pdf** file.

## **Usage** 

This work had a focus on the DW building and SQL queries, hence there is not many files to that part. Anyway, the AI model testing and development, as well as other relevant files, can be found in the Scripts and Files folder. This directory includes all the relevant information needed for the rest of the work.

## **Conclusion**

Although being an introductory work on these subjects, starting from a small sample, the final product showed good outcome on the build. It was useful to understand DW and OLAP, while providing insights on SQL queries.
